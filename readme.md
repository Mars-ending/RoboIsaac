# Game Description

## Game Title

**Survivor**

## Game Genre

**3D Top-Down / Action Shooter / Roguelite Survival**

------

## Project Overview

*Survivor* is a 3D action survival game independently developed using the Unity engine. The project is inspired by Roguelite games such as *The Binding of Isaac*, while adopting a distinct visual style and atmosphere.

The player takes on the role of a **skeleton survivor**, trapped in a **low-poly town**. Although the environment appears bright, calm, and visually appealing, hostile enemies continuously emerge from different areas of the town, disrupting the apparent peace. The player must survive in an environment that feels safe on the surface but is filled with constant threats.

The core objective of the game is not simply to eliminate all enemies, but to make strategic decisions between **risk and reward**. The player can choose to continue fighting and defeat more enemies to gain upgrades, or retreat in time by reaching an **extraction point** before the situation becomes unmanageable.

## Core Gameplay

### Physics-Based Combat

The game features a projectile-based combat system built on Unity’s **Rigidbody** physics system. Projectile behavior is fully driven by physics calculations, requiring players to rely on positioning, kiting, and prediction of enemy movement to land successful hits.

### Extraction Mechanic

Unlike traditional Roguelite games that require players to clear all enemies to progress, *Survivor* introduces an **extraction point mechanic**. Players can decide when to end the current run, a choice that directly affects both character progression and survival risk.

### Dynamic Difficulty Scaling

As the player survives longer in the town, both the number of enemies and their attack intensity gradually increase, continuously applying pressure and forcing more cautious and strategic decision-making.
